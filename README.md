### [Strikes for Rights](https://strikes-for-rights.vercel.app/index.html)

For my NHD 2022 project, I decided to build a website. Rather than using a website builder, I used my passion of coding and made it use HTML + TailwindCSS, it's hosted using vercel.

A roblox game which took about 4 months of development I released recently. Building done by SplashModel. I got to flesh out a basic framework, which I don't use anymore but taught me how to make my current highly efficient framework, Prism.

First released game! Everything was made by me. DASH was my adventure into obby/momentum based games, I had a lot of fun and learned some math along the way!

Those 3 are my main works, but you can scroll around my repo's to see what I'm up to. Finally, heres the link to me [Devforum Portfolio](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/acuaro-ui-designer-scripter/1090697). It has all Roblox game development related things on it.

*Soon I do want to begin work on a proper website portfolio, for it I'll plan on using NextJS+TailwindCSS+Vercel!*

## Thanks for reading! ðŸ‘‹
