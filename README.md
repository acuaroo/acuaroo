I love making games in roblox studio and have been using luau for over 3 years now. I own DASH, and am working on a revamp of it! I'm a semi-fullstack developer in the web sense, and have been doing HTML for around 3~4 years. Making games is my main passion, but on the side I love to write music, draw pixel art, and make websites!
